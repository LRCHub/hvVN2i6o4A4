Lights out times up to make the
call
Man up own up to what you are
Save them through your
conviction
Some choose to see when some
won’t
See past the laws that they hold
On to use for their desire
It’s all up to you
So do what you do
Destroyed by love to be built by
this hatred
That makes or breaks these
choices you’ve held on to
So feel the leap of faith taking
you over
Embrace your fear as you get
closer
Keeping your composure
In the end you know what you’ll
have to do
In the end it’ll all come back
to you
Better wake up
When you break out
Better wake up
When you break out
Arise out, the moment has begun
Man up its time to face the gun
Save them through your
conviction
Some choose to see when some
won’t
See past the lies they hold
So tell me what is your desire
It’s all up to you
So do what you do
Destroyed by love to be built by
this hatred
That makes or breaks these
choices you’ve held on to
So feel the leap of faith taking
you over
Embrace your fear as you get
closer
Keeping your composure
In the end you know what you’ll
have to do
In the end it’ll all come back
to you
Better wake up
When you break out
Better wake up
When you break out
Destroyed by love to be built by
this hatred
That makes or breaks these
choices you’ve held on to
So feel the leap of faith taking
you over
Embrace your fear as you get
closer
Keeping your composure
In the end you know what you’ll
have to do
In the end it’ll all come back
to you
Better wake up
When you break out
Better wake up
When you break out
